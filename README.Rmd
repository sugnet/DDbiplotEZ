library(DDbiplotEZ)
ddbiplot (Oils.data, scaled = TRUE) |> PCA() |> plot(type = "intervals")
ddbiplot (Oils.data, scaled = TRUE) |> PCA() |> vertices (type = "convexhull") |> 
  plot (type = "vertices")
ddbiplot (Oils.data, scaled = TRUE) |> PCA() |> vertices (type = "connect") |> 
  plot (type = "vertices")
